## Best Practice
1. Every Coginto route has a lambda

2. Using API Gateway integrated S3, no need for file transfer
3. Using Systems Manager to send command to ECS , no user_data or SSH  
4. Using IAM Identity Center for AWS-CLI SSO.  
[My AWS access portal URL](https://d-97675772b6.awsapps.com/start)  
Development users does not have permission to manage users
5. Each application has a role and is granted the minimum permissions
6. Scan dynamoDB is wasteful, so I use websocket to receive message from server, scan only when updated  
I know abusing websocket is not a good idea ^_^
